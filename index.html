    <h2>Goals of this site</h2>
<p>This site shows the output for different interactions with the CLI. I aim to focus on a set of different suites of of compiler errors, trying to find commonalities between the techniques different compilers and figure out what trade-offs folks are making.</p>
<h1><a href="./ambiguity"><code>Ambiguity</code></a> (wip)</h1>
<p>404 - Identifier not found. What does it look like when a language doesn't know what the string you've inputted looks like, or have duplicated the same one.</p>
<h1><a href="./assignability"><code>Assignability</code></a> (wip)</h1>
<p>What does it look like when you have two objects which are mis-matched, e.g. missing properties or different types.</p>
<h3>Extras</h3>
<h1><a href="./help"><code>--help</code></a></h1>
<p>How do you teach the basics?</p>
