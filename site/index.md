## Goals of this site

This site shows the output for different interactions with the CLI. I aim to focus on a set of different suites of of compiler errors, trying to find commonalities between the techniques different compilers and figure out what trade-offs folks are making.

# [`Ambiguity`](./ambiguity) (wip)

404 - Identifier not found. What does it look like when a language doesn't know what the string you've inputted looks like, or have duplicated the same one.

# [`Assignability`](./assignability) (wip)

What does it look like when you have two objects which are mis-matched, e.g. missing properties or different types.

### Extras

# [`--help`](./help)

How do you teach the basics?
