Hi, thank you for trying out Elm<span style="font-weight:normal;opacity:1;color:#fff;background:#000;"> 0.19.1</span>. I hope you like it!

<span style="color:#888;">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<span style="font-weight:normal;opacity:1;color:#fff;background:#000;">
</span>I highly recommend working through <https://guide.elm-lang.org> to get started.<span style="font-weight:normal;opacity:1;color:#fff;background:#000;">
</span>It teaches many important concepts, including how to use `elm` in the terminal.<span style="font-weight:normal;opacity:1;color:#fff;background:#000;">
</span>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<span style="font-weight:normal;opacity:1;color:#fff;background:#000;">

The most common commands are:

    elm repl</span>
        Open up an interactive programming session. Type in Elm expressions like
        (2 + 2) or (String.length "test") and see if they equal four!
    
    elm init<span style="font-weight:normal;opacity:1;color:#fff;background:#000;">
        Start an Elm project. It creates a starter elm.json file and provides a
        link explaining what to do from there.
    
    elm reactor</span>
        Compile code with a click. It opens a file viewer in your browser, and
        when you click on an Elm file, it compiles and you see the result.

There are a bunch of other commands as well though. Here is a full list:

    <span style="color:#00ffee;">elm repl    --help
    elm init    --help
    elm reactor --help
    elm make    --help
    elm install --help
    elm bump    --help
    elm diff    --help
    elm publish --help<span style="font-weight:normal;opacity:1;color:#fff;background:#000;">

Adding the --help flag gives a bunch of additional details about each one.

Be sure to ask on the Elm slack if you run into trouble! Folks are friendly and
happy to help out. They hang out there because it is fun, so be kind to get the
best results!
