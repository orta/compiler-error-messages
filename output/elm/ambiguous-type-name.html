<p>Occurs when Elm cannot resolve which 'map' to use from the two imports:</p>

<pre><code>
6m-- AMBIGUOUS NAME ------------------------------------------------------ Two.elm

This usage of `map` is ambiguous:

6| foo = map
         <span style="color:#F55">^^^</span>
This name is exposed by 2 of your imports, so I am not sure which one to use:

    <span style="color:#A50">Dict.map</span>[0m
    <span style="color:#A50">List.map</span>

I recommend using qualified names for imported values. I also recommend having
at most one `exposing (..)` per file to make name clashes like this less common
in the long run.

<u>No</u>te: Check out <https://elm-lang.org/0.19.1/imports> for more info on the
import syntax.
